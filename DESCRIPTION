Description: Provides an interface for Type III tests of model terms for any 
    user-provided estimation function via function test_terms(). This is 
    achieved by estimating a full model including all model terms, as well
    as restricted models in which the parameters corresponding to one model 
    term are withhold (i.e., set to zero). The test between the full model and 
    the restricted model can be  performed via any user-provided model 
    comparison function, the default uses the generic anova() function.
